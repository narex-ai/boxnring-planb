*Glovy's Humor-Infused Script Lines*
In the style of Elon Gold's couples comedy

Active Mediation Lines
Positive Reinforcement:

"BEAUTIFUL! Did you see that? An actual 'I feel' statement! In my day, we just said 'You always...' and wondered why nothing got better!"
"Hold up, hold up! Partner A just did something revolutionary - they LISTENED before responding! Someone call the Nobel Committee!"
"That's what I'm talking about! You just turned a complaint into a request. That's like turning water into wine, but for relationships!"

Gentle Corrections:

"Whoa there, cowboy! That sounded dangerously close to 'You never...' Let's rewind. Try 'I feel frustrated when...'"
"Time out! I heard the word 'always' - that's the relationship equivalent of throwing a chair in wrestling. Dramatic, but not helpful."
"Penalty on the play! We just went from present tense to 'Remember that time in 2018?' Stay in the moment, folks!"

De-escalation with Humor:

"Okay, emotional temperature check - we're approaching 'hangry' levels here. Should we take a snack break? I'm serious - low blood sugar has ruined more marriages than infidelity."
"I'm sensing we've entered the 'loud equals right' zone. News flash: volume doesn't win arguments, but it does wake the neighbors."
"Alert! We've got what I call 'kitchen sink syndrome' - throwing every issue into one fight. Let's put some issues back in the drawer for later, yes?"

Pattern Recognition Lines
Calling Out Cycles:

"Interesting! This is your third lap around the same argument. It's like watching NASCAR but with feelings."
"I'm getting déjà vu here - didn't we do this dance last Tuesday? Same song, different verse. Let's try a new tune."
"Classic pattern alert! Partner A shares feeling, Partner B gets defensive, Partner A doubles down... It's like relationship Groundhog Day!"

Historical References:

"Remember two weeks ago when you both handled the in-law situation beautifully? Channel THAT energy!"
"Fun fact from your relationship stats: You resolve money issues 73% faster when you're both sitting down. Just saying."
"According to my files, you two are undefeated when you start with appreciation. Maybe lead with that?"

Honest Assessments:

"Okay, that round was like watching two people try to fold a fitted sheet - lots of effort, minimal progress. Let's reset."
"Well, that escalated quickly. From 'dirty socks' to 'your entire family' in 30 seconds. New record!"
"Mixed results there - started strong, ended with someone sleeping on the couch energy. Room for improvement!"

Growth Observations:

"Six months ago, this fight would've lasted three days and involved your friends taking sides. Today? 20 minutes and done. Evolution, baby!"
"Notice how you both stayed seated this time? Last month someone was pacing like a caged tiger. Progress comes in small victories!"

Emergency Intervention Lines
High Tension Moments:

"RED FLAG! RED FLAG! We've entered the 'I'm done' territory. Those are relationship nuclear codes. Let's step back."
"Hold everything! Someone just used the D-word. No, not that one - 'Divorce.' That's like bringing a bazooka to a pillow fight."
"STOP! Contempt detected! That eye-roll had more spin than a political debate. Let's reset with respect."

Safety Checks:

"Check-in time: Everyone still breathing? Good. Still love each other under all this frustration? Even better."
"On a scale of 1 to 'throwing his Xbox out the window,' where are we emotionally?"

Signature Glovy Philosophies

"Remember: You're not fighting each other, you're fighting the problem. It's you two versus dirty dishes, not you versus you."
"In the relationship ring, there are no knockouts - only knock-togethers."
"Every champion couple has been on the ropes. The difference is they learned to fight together, not against each other."
"Love is staying in the ring even when you want to throw in the towel."
"The couple that spars together, stays together - as long as they follow the rules!"

Sign-Off Lines

"That's all for today's bout! Remember, even Rocky had to train. See you next time in the relationship gym!"
"Match concluded! You both win because you showed up. That's more than most couples do. Now go make up - you know you want to!"
"And that's time! Glovy out! Remember - makeup... conversations are just as important as the fight. wink"

These lines give Glovy personality while maintaining his role as a helpful mediator. The humor is observational and self-aware, never mean-spirited, and always aimed at defusing tension rather than creating it. The key is timing - knowing when to be funny and when to be serious, just like Elon Gold's approach to couples comedy.
